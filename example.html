Specific manifestations of these deficits vary according to chronological age, verbal and intellectual ability, and disorder severity. Manifestations may include limitations in the following:\n - Understanding of, interest in, or inappropriate responses to the verbal or non-verbal social communications of others.\n - Integration of spoken language with typical complimentary non-verbal cues, such as eye contact, gestures, facial expressions and body language. These non-verbal behaviours may also be reduced in frequency or intensity.\n - Understanding and use of language in social contexts and ability to initiate and sustain reciprocal social conversations. \n - Social awareness, leading to behaviour that is not appropriately modulated according to the social context.\n - Ability to imagine and respond to the feelings, emotional states, and attitudes of others.\n - Mutual sharing of interests.\n - Ability to make and sustain typical peer relationships.\n- Persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual\u2019s age and sociocultural context. These may include: \n - Lack of adaptability to new experiences and circumstances, with associated distress, that can be evoked by trivial changes to a familiar environment or in response to unanticipated events.\n - Inflexible adherence to particular routines; for example, these may be geographic such as following familiar routes, or may require precise timing such as mealtimes or transport.\n - Excessive adherence to rules (e.g., when playing games).\n - Excessive and persistent ritualized patterns of behaviour (e.g., preoccupation with lining up or sorting objects in a particular way) that serve no apparent external purpose. \n - Repetitive and stereotyped motor movements, such as whole body movements (e.g., rocking), atypical gait (e.g., walking on tiptoes), unusual hand or finger movements and posturing. These behaviours are particularly common during early childhood.\n - Persistent preoccupation with one or more special interests, parts of objects, or specific types of stimuli (including media) or an unusually strong attachment to particular objects (excluding typical comforters). \n - Lifelong excessive and persistent hypersensitivity or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli or unusual interest in a sensory stimulus, which may include actual or anticipated sounds, light, textures (especially clothing and food), odors and tastes, heat, cold, or pain.\n- The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but characteristic symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities.\n- The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder are able to function adequately in many contexts through exceptional effort, such that their deficits may not be apparent to others. A diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is still appropriate in such cases.\n\n## Specifiers for characterizing features within the Autism Spectrum: \n\nThese specifiers enable the identification of co-occurring limitations in intellectual and functional language abilities, which are important factors in the appropriate individualization of support, selection of interventions, and treatment planning for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A qualifier is also provided for loss of previously acquired skills, which is a feature of the developmental history of a small proportion of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n**Co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development**\n\nIndividuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may exhibit limitations in intellectual abilities. If present, a separate diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development should be assigned, using the appropriate category to designate severity (i.e., Mild, Moderate, Severe, Profound, Provisional). Because social deficits are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder, the assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development should place greater emphasis on the intellectual, conceptual, and practical domains of adaptive functioning than on social skills. \n\nIf no co-occurring diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development is present, the following qualifier for the Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis should be applied:\n\n- **without Disorder of Intellectual Development** \n\nIf there is a co-occurring diagnosis of Disorder of Intellectual Development, the following qualifier for the Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis should be applied, in addition to the appropriate diagnostic code for the co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development: \n\n- **with Disorder of Intellectual Development**\n\n**Degree of Functional Language Impairment**\n\nThe degree of impairment in functional language (spoken or signed) should be designated with a second qualifier. Functional language refers to the capacity of the individual to use language for instrumental purposes (e.g., to express personal needs and desires). This qualifier is intended to reflect primarily the verbal and non-verbal expressive language deficits present in some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder and not the pragmatic language deficits that are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder. \n\nThe following qualifier should be applied to indicate the extent of functional language impairment (spoken or signed) relative to the individual\u2019s age:\n\n- **with mild or no impairment of functional language**\n- **with impaired functional language** (i.e., not able to use more than single words or simple phrases)\n- **with complete, or almost complete, absence of functional language**\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n**Table 6.5 Diagnostic Codes for Autism Spectrum Disorder**\n\n\u003Cbr\u003E\n\n| | with mild or no impairment of functional language | with impaired functional language | with complete, or almost complete, absence of functional language | \n| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | \n| \u003Cbr\u003Ewithout Disorder of Intellectual Development\u003Cbr\u003E | 6A02.0 | 6A02.2 | _____ | \n| with Disorder of Intellectual Development | 6A02.1 | 6A02.3 | 6A02.5 | \n| | | | | \n\nTable 6.5 shows the diagnostic codes corresponding to the categories that result from the application of the specifiers for Co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development and Degree of Functional Language Impairment.\n\n**6A02.Y Other Specified Autism Spectrum Disorder** can be used if the above parameters do not apply.\n\n**6A02.Z Autism Spectrum Disorder, Unspecified** can be used if the above parameters are unknown.\n\n**Loss of Previously Acquired Skills**\n\nA small proportion of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may present with a loss of previously acquired skills. This regression typically occurs during the second year of life and most often involves language use and social responsiveness. Loss of previously acquired skills is rarely observed after 3 years of age. If it occurs after age 3, it is more likely to involve loss of cognitive and adaptive skills (e.g., loss of bowel and bladder control, impaired sleep), regression of language and social abilities, as well as increasing emotional and behavioural disturbances.\n\nThere are two alternative specifiers, to denote whether or not loss of previously acquired skills is an aspect of the clinical history, where x corresponds to the final digit shown in Table 6.5:\n\n- **6A02.x0 without loss of previously acquired skills**\n- **6A02.x1 with loss of previously acquired skills**\n\n## Additional Clinical Features:\n\n- Common symptom presentations of Autism Spectrum Disorder in young children are parental or caregiver concerns about intellectual or other developmental delays (e.g., problems in language and motor coordination). When there is no significant impairment of intellectual functioning, clinical services may only be sought later (e.g., due to behaviour or social problems when starting school). In middle childhood, there may be prominent symptoms of anxiety, including Social Anxiety Disorder, school refusal, and Specific Phobia. During adolescence and adulthood, Depressive Disorders are often a presenting feature. \n- Co-occurrence of Autism Spectrum Disorder with other Mental, Behavioural or Neurodevelopmental Disorders is common across the lifespan. In a substantial proportion of cases, particularly in adolescence and adulthood, it is a co-occurring disorder that first brings an individual with Autism Spectrum Disorder to clinical attention. \n- Pragmatic language difficulties may manifest as an overly literal understanding of others\u2019 speech, speech that lacks normal prosody and emotional tone and therefore appears monotonous, lack of awareness of the appropriateness of their choice of language in particular social contexts, or pedantic precision in the use of language. \n- Social naivet\u00E9, especially during adolescence, can lead to exploitation by others, a risk that may be enhanced by the use of social media without adequate supervision.\n- Profiles of specific cognitive skills in Autism Spectrum Disorder as measured by standardized assessments may show striking and unusual patterns of strengths and weaknesses that are highly variable from individual to individual. These deficits can affect learning and adaptive functioning to a greater extent than would be predicted from the overall scores on measures of verbal and non-verbal intelligence. \n- Self-injurious behaviours (e.g., hitting one\u2019s face, head banging) occur more often in individuals with co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development. \n- Some young individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, especially those with a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development, develop epilepsy or seizures during early childhood with a second increase in prevalence during adolescence. Catatonic states have also been described. A number of medical disorders such as Tuberous Sclerosis, chromosomal abnormalities including Fragile X Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, early onset epileptic encephalopathies, and Neurofibromatosis are associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder with or without a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development. Genomic deletions, duplications and other genetic abnormalities are increasingly described in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, some of which may be important for genetic counselling. Prenatal exposure to valproate is also associated with an increased risk of Autism Spectrum Disorder. \n- Some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder are capable of functioning adequately by making an exceptional effort to compensate for their symptoms during childhood, adolescence or adulthood. Such sustained effort, which may be more typical of affected females, can have a deleterious impact on mental health and well-being.\n\n## Boundary with Normality (Threshold):\n\n- ***Social interaction skills:*** Typically developing individuals vary in the pace and extent to which they acquire and master skills of reciprocal social interaction and social communication. A diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder should only be considered if there is marked and persistent deviation from the expected range of abilities and behaviours in these domains given the individual\u2019s age, level of intellectual functioning, and sociocultural context. Some individuals may exhibit limited social interaction due to shyness (i.e., feelings of awkwardness or fear in new situations or with unfamiliar people) or behavioural inhibition (i.e., being slow to approach or to \u2018warm up\u2019 to new people and situations). Limited social interactions in shy or behaviourally inhibited children, adolescents, or adults are not indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Shyness is differentiated from Autism Spectrum Disorder by evidence of adequate social communication behaviours in familiar situations.\n- ***Social communication skills:*** Children vary widely in the age at which they first acquire spoken language and the pace at which their speech and language become firmly established. Most children with early language delay eventually acquire similar language skills as their same-age peers. Early language delay alone is not strongly indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder unless there is also evidence of limited motivation for social communication and limited interaction skills. An essential feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder is persistent impairment in the ability to understand and use language appropriately for social communication. \n- ***Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours:*** Many children go through phases of repetitive play and highly focused interests as a part of typical development. Unless there is also evidence of impaired reciprocal social interaction and social communication, patterns of behaviour characterized by repetition, routine, or restricted interests are not by themselves indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n\n## Course Features: \n\n- Although Autism Spectrum Disorder can present clinically at all ages, including during adulthood, it is a lifelong disorder the manifestations and impact of which are likely to vary according to age, intellectual and language abilities, co-occurring conditions and environmental context.\n- Restricted and repetitive behaviours persist over time. Specifically, repetitive sensorimotor behaviours appear to be common, consistent, and potentially severe. During the school age years and adolescence, these repetitive sensorimotor behaviours begin to lessen in intensity and number. Insistence on sameness, which is less prevalent, appears to develop during preschool and worsen over time. \n\n## Developmental Presentations:\n\n- *Infancy:* Characteristic features may emerge during infancy although they may only be recognized as indicative of Autism Spectrum Disorder in retrospect. It is usually possible to make the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder during the preschool period (up to 4 years), especially in children exhibiting generalized developmental delay. Plateauing of social communication and language skills and failure to progress in their development is not uncommon. The loss of early words and social responsiveness, i.e., a true regression, with an onset between 1 and 2 years, is unusual but significant and rarely occurs after the third year of life. In these cases, the qualifier \u2018with loss of previously acquired skills\u2019 should be applied. \n- *Preschool:* In preschool children, indicators of an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis often include avoidance of mutual eye contact, resistance to physical affection, a lack of social imaginary play, language that is delayed in onset or is precocious but not used for social conversation; social withdrawal, obsessive or repetitive preoccupations, and a lack of social interaction with peers characterized by parallel play or disinterest. Sensory sensitivities to everyday sounds, or to foods, may overshadow the underlying social communication deficits. \n- *Middle Childhood:* In children with Autism Spectrum Disorder without a Disorder of Intellectual Development, social adjustment difficulties outside the home may not be detected until school entry or adolescence when social communication problems lead to social isolation from peers. Resistance to engage in unfamiliar experiences and marked reactions to even minor change in routines are typical. Furthermore, excessive focus on detail as well as rigidity of behaviour and thinking may be significant. Symptoms of anxiety may become evident at this stage of development.\n- *Adolescence:* By adolescence, the capacity to cope with increasing social complexity in peer relationships at a time of increasingly demanding academic expectations is often overwhelmed. In some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the underlying social communication deficits may be overshadowed by the symptoms of co-occurring Mental and Behavioural Disorders. Depressive symptoms are often a presenting feature\n- *Adulthood:* In adulthood, the capacity for those with Autism Spectrum Disorder to cope with social relationships can become increasingly challenged, and clinical presentation may occur when social demands overwhelm the capacity to compensate. Presenting problems in adulthood may represent reactions to social isolation or the social consequences of inappropriate behaviour. Compensation strategies may be sufficient to sustain dyadic relationships, but are usually inadequate in social groups. Special interests, and focused attention, may benefit some individuals in education and employment. Work environments may have to be tailored to the capacities of the individual. A first diagnosis in adulthood may be precipitated by a breakdown in domestic or work relationships. In Autism Spectrum Disorder there is always a history of early childhood social communication and relationship difficulties, although this may only be apparent in retrospect.\n\n## Culture-Related Features:\n\n- Cultural variation exists in norms of social communication, reciprocal social interactions, as well as interests and activities. Therefore, signs of impairment in functioning may differ depending on cultural context. For example, in some societies it may be normative for children may avoid direct eye contact out of deference, which should not be misinterpreted as impairment in social interaction.\n\n## Sex- and/or Gender-Related Features:\n\n- Males are four times more likely than females to be diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n- Females diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder are more frequently diagnosed with co-occurring Disorders of Intellectual Development, suggesting that less severe presentations may go undetected as compared to males. Females tend to demonstrate fewer restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours than males. \n- During middle-childhood, gender differences in presentation differentially affect functioning. Boys may act out with reactive aggression or other behavioural symptoms when challenged or frustrated. Girls tend to withdraw socially, and react with emotional changes to their social adjustment difficulties. \n\n## Boundaries with Other Disorders and Conditions (Differential Diagnosis):\n\n- ***Boundary with Disorders of Intellectual Development:*** Autism Spectrum Disorder may be diagnosed in individuals with Disorders of Intellectual Development if deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions are greater than would be expected based on the individual\u2019s level of intellectual functioning and if the other diagnostic requirements for Autism Spectrum Disorder are also met. In these circumstances, both Autism Spectrum Disorder and the Disorder of Intellectual Development should be assigned and the \u2018with Disorder of Intellectual Development\u2019 qualifier should be applied with the Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis. Because Autism Spectrum Disorder inherently involves social deficits, assessment of adaptive behaviour as a part of the diagnosis of a co-occurring Disorder of Intellectual Development should place greater emphasis on intellectual functioning and the conceptual and practical domains of adaptive functioning rather than on social skills. The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder in individuals with Severe and Profound Disorders of Intellectual Development is particularly difficult, and requires in-depth and longitudinal assessments. However, the diagnosis may be assigned if skills in social reciprocity and communication are significantly impaired relative to the individual\u2019s general level of intellectual ability.\n- ***Boundary with Developmental Language Disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language:*** Individuals with Developmental Language Disorder with impairment of mainly pragmatic language exhibit language deficits involving the ability to understand and use language in social context (i.e., with pragmatic language impairment). Unlike individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, individuals with Developmental Language Disorder are usually able to initiate and respond appropriately to social and emotional cues and to share interests with others, and do not typically exhibit restricted, repetitive and stereotyped behaviours. An additional diagnosis of Developmental Language Disorder should not be assigned to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder based solely on pragmatic language impairment. The other forms of Developmental Language Disorder (i.e., with impairment of receptive and expressive language or with impairment of receptive and expressive language) may be assigned in conjunction with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder if language abilities are markedly below what would be expected on the basis of age and level of intellectual functioning.\n- ***Boundary with Developmental Motor Coordination Disorder:*** Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may be reluctant to participate in tasks requiring complex motor coordination skills, such as ball sports, which is better accounted for by a lack of interest rather than any specific deficits in motor coordination. However, Developmental Motor Coordination Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder can co-occur and both diagnoses may be assigned if warranted. \n- ***Boundary with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder:*** Specific abnormalities in attention (e.g., being overly focused or easily distracted), impulsivity, and physical hyperactivity are often observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder do not exhibit the persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions or the persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are the defining features of Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder can co-occur and both diagnoses may be assigned if diagnostic requirements are met for each. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder symptoms may sometimes dominate the clinical presentation such that some Autism Spectrum Disorder symptoms are less apparent.\n- ***Boundary with Stereotyped Movement Disorder:*** Stereotyped Movement Disorder is characterized by voluntary, repetitive, stereotyped, apparently purposeless (and often rhythmic) movements that arise during the early developmental period. Although such stereotypies are typical in Autism Spectrum Disorder, if they are severe enough to require additional clinical attention, for example because of self-injury, a co-occurring diagnosis of Stereotyped Movement Disorder may be warranted.\n- ***Boundary with Schizophrenia:*** The onset of Schizophrenia may be associated with prominent social withdrawal, which is either preceded by or results in social impairments that may resemble social deficits seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, unlike Autism Spectrum Disorder, the onset of Schizophrenia is typically in adolescence or early adulthood and extremely rare prior to puberty. Schizophrenia is differentiated on the basis of the presence of psychotic symptoms (e.g., delusions, hallucinations) as well as a lack of restricted, repetitive and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities during early childhood typical of Autism Spectrum Disorder.\n- ***Boundary with Schizotypal Disorder:*** Interpersonal difficulties seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder may share some features of Schizotypal Disorder, such as poor rapport with others and social withdrawal. However, Autism Spectrum Disorder is also characterized by restricted, repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities.\n- ***Boundary with Social Anxiety Disorder:*** Social Anxiety Disorder is associated with limited engagement in social interaction due to marked and excessive fear or anxiety about negatively evaluated by others. Typically, when interacting with familiar others or in social situations that do not provoke significant anxiety, there is no evidence of impairment. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may experience social anxiety, but they also exhibit more pervasive deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions than are typically observed in Social Anxiety Disorder. Persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities are not features of Social Anxiety Disorder.\n- ***Boundary with Selective Mutism:*** Selective Mutism is characterized by normal use of language and patterns of social communication in specific environments, such as the home, but not in others, such as at school. In Autism Spectrum Disorder, a reluctance to communicate may be observed in some social circumstances, but deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions and persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities are evident across all situations and contexts.\n- ***Boundary with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder:*** Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is characterized by persistent repetitive thoughts, images, or impulses/urges (i.e., obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviours (i.e., compulsions) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession, according to rigid rules, to reduce anxiety or to achieve a sense of \u2018completeness\u2019. These symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Unlike those with Autism Spectrum Disorder, it is more common for individuals with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder to consciously resist their impulsive/urges to perform compulsive behaviours (e.g., by performing alternate tasks), though adolescents and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder may also try to suppress specific behaviours that they realize are socially undesirable. Autism Spectrum Disorder can also be distinguished from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder by its characteristic deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions, which are not features of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.\n- ***Boundary with Reactive Attachment Disorder:*** Reactive Attachment Disorder is characterized by inhibited emotionally withdrawn behaviour exhibited toward adult caregivers, including a failure to approach a discriminated, preferred attachment figure for comfort, support, protection or nurturance. The diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary caregiver or other forms of severe social deprivation (e.g., certain types of institutionalization). Some individuals reared under conditions of severe deprivation in institutional settings exhibit autistic-like features including difficulties in social reciprocity and restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Also referred to as \u2018quasi-autism\u2019, affected individuals are differentiated from those with Autism Spectrum Disorder based on significant improvement of autism-like features when the child is moved to a more nurturing environment. Differentiation between Reactive Attachment Disorder and Autism Spectrum Disorder is difficult when no reliable evidence is available of intact social and communicative development prior to the onset of abuse or neglect.\n- ***Boundary with Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder:*** Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is characterized by persistent indiscriminate social approaches to unfamiliar adults and peers, a pattern of behaviour that may also be seen in some children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. The diagnosis of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder requires evidence of a history of severe neglect or maltreatment by the primary caregiver or other forms of severe social deprivation (e.g., certain types of institutionalization). As in Reactive Attachment Disorder, Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder may be associated with generalized deficits in social understanding and social communication. Although they may occur, restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities are not typical features of Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder. Evidence of a significant reduction in symptoms when the child is provided a more nurturing environment suggests that Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder is the appropriate diagnosis.\n- ***Boundary with Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder:*** Individuals with Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder sometimes restrict their food intake based on food\u2019s sensory characteristics such as smell, taste, temperature, texture or appearance. Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder may also restrict intake of certain foods because of their sensory characteristics or because of inflexible adherence to particular routines. However, Autism Spectrum Disorder is also characterized by persistent deficits in initiating and sustaining social communication and reciprocal social interactions and persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are unrelated to food. If a pattern of restricted eating in an individual with Autism Spectrum Disorder has caused significant weight loss or other health consequences or is specifically associated with significant functional impairment, an additional diagnosis of Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder may be assigned.\n- ***Boundary with Oppositional Defiant Disorder:*** Oppositional Defiant Disorder is characterized by a pattern of markedly noncompliant, defiant, and disobedient disruptive behaviour that is not typical for individuals of comparable age and developmental level. Individuals with Oppositional Defiant Disorder do not exhibit the social communication deficits or restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities that are characteristic of Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, oppositional or \u2018demand avoidant\u2019 behaviour may be prominent in some children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, whether or not they have accompanying intellectual or functional language impairments and may sometimes be the presenting feature in school-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. Disruptive behaviour with aggressive outbursts (explosive rages) may also be a prominent feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder, such outbursts are often associated with a specific trigger (e.g., a change in routine, aversive sensory stimulation, anxiety, or rigidity when the individual\u2019s thoughts or behaviour sequences are interrupted), rather than reflecting an intention to be defiant, provocative, or spiteful, as is more typical of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. \n- ***Boundary with Personality Disorder:*** Personality Disorder is a pervasive disturbance in how an individual experiences and thinks about the self, others, and the world, manifested in maladaptive patterns of cognition, emotional experience, emotional expression, and behaviour. The maladaptive patterns are relatively inflexible, manifest across a range of personal and social situations, relatively stable over time, and of long duration. They are associated with significant problems in psychosocial functioning that are particularly evident in interpersonal relationships. The difficulties some individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder exhibit in initiating and maintaining relationships because of their limited skills in social communication and reciprocal social interactions may resemble those seen in some individuals with Personality Disorder. However, unlike Autism Spectrum Disorder, persistent restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities with onset in early childhood are not characteristic features of Personality Disorder. \n- ***Boundary with Primary Tics or Tic Disorders including Tourette Syndrome:*** Sudden, rapid, non-rhythmic, and recurrent movements or vocalizations occur in Primary Tics and Tic Disorders, which may resemble repetitive and stereotyped motor movements in Autism Spectrum Disorder. Unlike Autism Spectrum Disorder, tics in Primary Tics and Tic Disorders tend to be less stereotyped, are often accompanied by premonitory sensory urges, last for a shorter period, tend to emerge later in life, and are not experienced by the individual as soothing.\n- ***Boundary with Diseases of the Nervous System and other medical conditions classified elsewhere:*** Loss of previously acquired skills in language and social communication in the second year of life is reported in some children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, but this rarely occurs after the age of 3 years. Diseases of the Nervous System and other medical conditions associated with regression (e.g., acquired epileptic aphasia or Landau Kleffner syndrome, autoimmune encephalitis, Rett Syndrome) are differentiated from Autism Spectrum Disorder with loss of previously acquired skills on the basis of an early history of relatively normal social and language development and by the characteristic neurological features of these disorders that are not typical of Autism Spectrum Disorder. \n- ***Boundary with Secondary Neurodevelopmental Syndrome:*** Autistic features may become manifest in the context of acquired medical conditions, such as encephalitis. Identifying accurately whether the symptoms are secondary to another medical condition or represent the exacerbation of pre-existing Autism Spectrum Disorder may have implications for both immediate management and prognosis. When autistic symptoms are attributable to another medical condition, a diagnosis of Secondary Neurodevelopmental Syndrome rather than Autism Spectrum Disorder may be assigned."},"title":{"@language":"en","@value":"Autism spectrum disorder"},"synonym":[{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"Autistic disorder"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"autistic"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"autistic disorder of childhood onset"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"infantile autism"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"childhood autism"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"Kanner syndrome"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"Pervasive developmental delay NOS"}},{"label":{"@language":"en","@value":"pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified"}}],"definition":{"@language":"en","@value":"Autism spectrum disorder is characterised by persistent deficits in the ability to initiate and to sustain reciprocal social interaction and social communication, and by a range of restricted, repetitive, and inflexible patterns of behaviour, interests or activities that are clearly atypical or excessive for the individual\u2019s age and sociocultural context. The onset of the disorder occurs during the developmental period, typically in early childhood, but symptoms may not become fully manifest until later, when social demands exceed limited capacities. Deficits are sufficiently severe to cause impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are usually a pervasive feature of the individual\u2019s functioning observable in all settings, although they may vary according to social, educational, or other context.
